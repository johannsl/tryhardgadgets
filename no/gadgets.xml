                    Have you ever desired a BULLETPROOF vest that looks like a keyboard? Well, the brand new Nerdstopper Blacksuite
                    Acevest might be just the thing for you! Made of uranium, mined from the deepest mines of Iran by underpaid
                    savages and enriched by mad scientists, this piece of art will stop anything from the old Purple Nurple to nearly
                    any modern atomic bombs! Worried about the war brewing in the west? Put on your vest, and worry no more!
                    Coated by 573 layers of compressed carbon, smoothed out with the finest oil Italy can provide and hand-painted
                    keyboard-esque symbols, not only will the vest make you look amazing, but also work as a modern-day female
                    repellant - which will keep you out of harms way of even more drama! The vest is so good, every single developer
                    of Tryhard Gadgets owns one, and highly recommend buyers from all over the globe to buy one! You know, because
                    when atomic bombs starts falling, having a Nerstopper Blacsuite Acevest packed under your bed isn't the worst
                    of luck. Buy now, buy now, buy now, buy now, buy now, buy now!
